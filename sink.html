    This file exists to play nicely with password managers.

The difference is in the newly introduced <iframe> and the added attributes on the <form> element. By providing an action, target and method, the form will be posted to sink.html in the iframe, aside from calling the ngSubmit function. This way the browserâ€™s normal form processing logic will kick in, without navigating to sink.html (at least not in the main window). Password managers will recognize this as a regular form submission, and ask to store the credentials on the keychain.
